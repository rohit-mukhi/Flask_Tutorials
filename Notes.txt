By far this is the most frustrating setup I have done.

To setup a python project, open pycharm, clone a github repo you want to work in.
Then pycharm will ask you to set up an interpreter, do it. Do not select create a new venv, select
existing venv.

Do not forget to activate the venv!!!!

Then use pip install to download all dependencies, here a dependency is flask.
You need to create a requirements.txt file by using the following command:
    pip freeze > reqirements.txt

In development, you need to install the dependencies so you have the reqirements.txt file listing all the dependencies. To install the dependencies in the reqirements.txt file use the following command:

    pip install -r reqirements.txt

To run the flask app, you need to use the following command:

    flask --app <filename> run

You will get a link to the browser, where you can see all the updates.

You can the basic app that will run in the app.py file

Now you need to create a new folder called templates. This is where all the html pages will go.
When you add the html file in templates folder, then the html file created will not have a meta
tag. You can add that tag from vscode template.

*************************************************************************************************************

In a flask application, the templates files are for storing html files only. Nothing else.
To store any css, js or images, we need to have another folder called static. This folder named static must 
have again 3 folders for css, js and images respectively. This is standard and recommended for good 
performance of a flask project.
