By far this is the most frustrating setup I have done.

To setup a python project, open pycharm, clone a github repo you want to work in.
Then pycharm will ask you to set up an interpreter, do it. Do not select create a new venv, select
existing venv.

Then use pip install to download all dependencies, here a dependency is flask.
You need to create a requirements.txt file by using the following command:
    pip freeze > reqirements.txt

To run the flask app, you need to use the following command:

    flask --app <filename> run

You will get a link to the browser, where you can see all the updates.

You can the basic app that will run in the app.py file

Now you need to create a new folder called templates. This is where all the html pages will go.
When you add the html file in templates folder, then the html file created will not have a meta
tag. You can add that tag from vscode template.
